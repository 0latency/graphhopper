# GraphHopper [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper)

Java road routing engine

Purpose
---------------

Solving shortest path (related) problems is the main goal. GraphHopper is a routing engine which
makes implementing shortest path problems in Java easier and more efficient (faster, less memory, etc) than
a naive implementation.
GraphHopper is tuned for road networks at the moment but can be useful for public transport problems in
the future as well.

Features
---------------

 * 100% Java and 100% Open Source
 * Memory efficient and fast
 * A small library (~3MB)
 * Works on the [desktop](http://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/graphhopper.png), 
   [as a web service](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-web) 
   and even offline [on Android](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/wiki/Android)
 * Well tested
